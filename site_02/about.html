          <p>In addition to his professional career, Joe has taught law and lectured on legal matters at Syracuse
            University and in numerous continuing legal education programs.</p>

          <p>Joe has a broad range of experience, which he can bring to bear on behalf of his clients. Working in both
            the accounting and legal worlds in tax controversy matters not only gives him a unique perspective, it
            enables him to arrive at a solution in a timely and cost-effective manner.</p>

          <p>Throughout his years as a CPA and attorney, Joe participated in several long-term audits and investigations

          <p>Joe also has extensive experience with commercial clients and lenders, having participated in numerous
            commercial transactions, asset purchases and sales, stock sales and business formations. His tax background
            has allowed him to successfully structure New York State-regulated bulk sales transactions, federal and
            state tax offers in compromise and offshore voluntary disclosure program (OVDP) submissions.</p>

          <p>Joe's achievements include the representation of several well-known New York residents and businesses for
            tax evasion and tax fraud, as well as numerous lenders, businesses and individuals in commercial
            transactions.</p>
